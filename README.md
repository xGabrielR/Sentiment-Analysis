<h2>0. Project Objectives</h2>
<hr>

<p>In this project I focused much more on a recipe book for classic machine learning solutions for NLP tasks I followed several interesting subjects that I identified throughout my studies and to summarize all of this I developed some pipelines in pyspark and also made some comparisons with sentiment analysis with modern tools such as: Roberta, Chatgpt (GPT), LLAMA and Falcon ("Free Gpt alternative") all aimed at solving sentiment analysis.</p>

<p>In this small project I aim to train my skills with Spark on multiclass classification problems.</p>

<p>The project basically consists of sentiment analysis pipeline using kaggle dataset product reviews on this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews.</p>

<p>There is no strong business reason to solve any business problem involving the project, just for tool studies. The main goal is clean and preprocess text data and represents this text in a vector for classic machine learning for classify three different labels (bad, neutral and good) scores of this text vector representation.</p>

<p>I tried classic NLP methods like tokenization, StopWords, TD-IDF, etc. In "Next Steps", I mention some improvements that I would make to the code, but at this moment I will not apply them as we are working within a cyclical development method.</p>
